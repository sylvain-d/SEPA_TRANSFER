Manage SEPA transfer

This is not CODE but an excel file, paired with an xml to manage multiple simple SEPA transfer orders
It helped a small company to handle grant transfer each month, if it can help other, this will be great

To validate the XML generated you can use editor like Notepad++ and XML Tool plugin that allows you to validate your XML with the official PSD.

The XML file may be delivered to your bank in order to be processed but before that make sure that your bank validates it one last time.
